# Movies App

## Introduction

I started the development process with React, but since React now recommends using frameworks like Next.js or Remix, I decided to migrate the project to Next.js after completing the profile section. Below are some screenshots of the React development phase. 

The link to the Next.js version of the project can be found on GitHub: [Next.js Project Link](https://github.com/earslanyunus/movies-app-nextjs)
